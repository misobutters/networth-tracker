		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Development Environment",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup into: repository creation, frontend scaffolding, backend scaffolding, tooling/configuration (TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier), and documentation (README, contribution guidelines).",
			"reasoning": "This task is foundational but follows standard patterns and tools. Complexity is moderate due to multi-stack setup and tooling, but each step is well-documented in industry practice and can be parallelized."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement User Authentication (Registration & Login)",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: user schema design, registration endpoint, login endpoint, password hashing, JWT implementation, frontend forms, and secure token storage.",
			"reasoning": "Authentication involves backend and frontend integration, security best practices (hashing, JWT, secure storage), and error handling. Each component is critical and must be robust, increasing complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Design and Implement Data Models for Categories and Entries",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: category model, entry model, schema validation, database selection/configuration, migration scripts, and unit tests for models.",
			"reasoning": "Data modeling is central to application integrity. It requires careful schema design, validation, and migration planning, but follows established ORM/ODM and migration patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "CRUD APIs for Categories (Assets & Liabilities)",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: create endpoint, read endpoint, update endpoint, delete endpoint, authentication/authorization middleware, and input validation.",
			"reasoning": "CRUD API development is standard but must enforce security and data integrity. Each endpoint and middleware can be a subtask, following RESTful conventions."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "CRUD APIs for Financial Entries",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: create entry endpoint, read entries endpoint, update entry endpoint, delete entry endpoint, linkage validation (categories/users), and input validation.",
			"reasoning": "Similar to category APIs, but with additional linkage and validation requirements. Complexity is moderate and can be modularized by endpoint and validation logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend: Category and Entry Management UI",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: category list component, category form component, entry list component, entry form component, API integration, form validation, and responsive design.",
			"reasoning": "UI development for CRUD flows requires multiple components, state management, validation, and UX considerations. Each UI element and integration point is a logical subtask."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Data Persistence and Security",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: database access controls, authentication middleware, authorization checks, sensitive data encryption, backup procedures, restore procedures, user data isolation, and security testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task covers multiple security domains (access control, encryption, backups) and requires careful, layered implementation to meet best practices and compliance standards."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Interactive Dashboard and Charts",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: dashboard layout, net worth calculation, historical trends chart, asset/liability breakdown chart, date range filter, backend data aggregation, chart integration, and UI testing.",
			"reasoning": "Building an interactive dashboard involves complex data aggregation, multiple chart types, frontend-backend coordination, and advanced UI/UX work. Each chart and data flow is a distinct subtask."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend: User Profile and Settings",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: profile page UI, profile update form, password change flow, settings UI, settings persistence, and secure update handling.",
			"reasoning": "Profile and settings management require secure forms, state management, and integration with backend APIs. Complexity is moderate, with each flow as a subtask."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Testing, QA, and Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: integration tests, end-to-end tests, user documentation, API documentation, data model documentation, bug triage/fixes, and QA review.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive testing and documentation are critical for quality and maintainability. Each testing/documentation type and bug fixing can be handled as a focused subtask."
