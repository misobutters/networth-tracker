1. Introduction

The application will enable users to define their own asset and liability categories and visualize their financial progress over time with beautiful, interactive charts.

1.2. Target Audience
This application is designed for individuals who want to take control of their financial lives, from those just starting their financial journey to experienced investors. The primary target audience is users who prefer a hands-on approach to personal finance and want a visual representation of their net worth.

2. Scope
2.1. Core Features
User-Defined Categories: Users can create, edit, and delete custom categories for both assets and liabilities (e.g., "Stocks," "Crypto," "Real Estate," "Credit Card Debt," "Mortgage").

Interactive Dashboards and Charts:

A main dashboard displaying the current net worth.

Historical trend charts showing net worth over time (line chart).

Breakdown charts (pie or donut charts) showing the composition of assets and liabilities by category.

Custom date range filters for all charts.

Data Persistence: User data will be securely stored to allow for tracking over time.

Stock market data fetching and real-time updates.

Tax and retirement planning advice.

Collaboration or multi-user features.

3. User Stories
As a user, I want to...
...create a new asset category so I can track my investments separately from my cash.

...add a new entry for my savings account so my net worth is up to date.

...see a line chart of my net worth over the past year so I can visualize my financial growth.

...view a pie chart showing the percentage of my net worth in different asset categories so I can understand my portfolio allocation.

...edit an incorrect entry so my data is accurate.

...delete an old liability so it no longer appears on my tracker.

4. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Average Sessions per User: Track how often users are engaging with the application.
